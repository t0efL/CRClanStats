# CRClanStats
**An app for tracking clan statistics in the game Clash Royale.**

You can use it to collect statistics for the entire clan as a whole,
as well as for individual players.
The word statistics refers to the statistics of the clan in wars.
The user is required to save data in time,
after which they can access statistics at any time.
This can help the leader of the clan decide who should be promoted,
and who should be demoted or kicked out.

In this application, which creates a simulation of your clan, you can:
* Add new Member;
* Remove member;
* Save War results; 
* Get information about the selected member; 
* Get average data about the entire clan; 
* Get members list; 
* Change last war results; 
* Save changes;
* Reset Data; 
* Change the saved clan name. 

All these functions and some others are presented
in the main menu of the app.
By selecting any of the items 
you will be explicitly told what to do next.
To go to the menu during the execution of any of the items,
enter "menu" in the input bar.

The user is required to tell the app only the result 
of the day of war and the day of collection for each player.
Based on this data, the following indicators can be calculated 
for each player or for the entire clan as a whole(average):
* Wars played;
* Wins;
* Loses;
* Average Cards on Collection day;
* Win Rate;
* Longest win streak;
* Current win streak;
* Current loss streak;
* Last results.

To save all the data you entered for future use,
use the "Save changes" option in the menu before closing the program.
If you select "Quit" in the menu without saving the data first,
the program will remind you of this.

To run this program, make sure that you have Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as a framework for it called NumPy. The latter can be set by entering the following text in the command line:
!pip install numpy

Then you can run the file main.py and start using the app.
